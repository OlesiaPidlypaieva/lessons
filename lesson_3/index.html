            <h2 id="about">About The UFF </h2>
            <p> <span class="bold-font">The Ukrainian Freedom Fund (UFF)</span> re-activated in response to Russia’s continued, unprovoked, and illegal war of aggression against Ukraine. We are currently prioritizing 5 campaigns: Support Ukraine, Drones for Defenders, Train and Assist Ukraine, Medical Aid for Ukraine, and Vehicles for Defense. Our Individual Security Kits campaign is deactivated due to a saturation of protective equipment in Ukraine. 
            </p>
            <h2 id="reasons">Why Choose UFF?</h2>
            <p>We are unique in that we are small, agile, and headquartered in Kyiv. We don’t lose aid to international corruption, and we don’t rely on other organizations for delivery. In fact, we were forced to set aside storage space due to the volume of material being given to us by other charities that are either unwilling to bring the humanitarian aid east of Kyiv or lack sufficient contacts and volunteer networks to get the aid where it is most needed.
